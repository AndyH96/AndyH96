### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name's Andy.

Coming from Montreal, Canada - I am a Data Scientist and Master of Science (MSc) student in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence with a structured approach and a knack for creative solutions to real-world problems. I am passionate about health, education, and sustainable practices.

I have experience in the nutrition, pharmaceutical, and health-tech sectors and I am currently working full-time as a Data Analyst at Oviva - working with the NHS to help Type 2 Diabetic patients while funding my independent postgraduate studies in AI. 

I am skilled in SQL, Python, C/C++, MATLAB , Google Cloud Platform (GCP), database structure, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and various Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
